# Cplusplus-Program

Summary:
The code in this repository was used to develop an investment calculator. It provides the user the ability to calculate the annual compound interest of their account balance. Which the results will be conveyed with and without a monthly deposit.

What did you do particularly well?
The calculations in the code are done correctly. Annual interest without monthly deposits calculates the interest earned per year based off of the initial investment. The annual interest with monthly deposits divides the interest per year by month. Which calculates each monthly deposit plus the account balance by a twelfth of the annual interest. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Where I can enhance my code, is the tables where the interest results are displayed. When some numbers are different digit sizes, the table gets misaligned. This would require more time fiddling around with the output methods to get them to aligne perfectly. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
